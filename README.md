Interactive Safety Education Toy for Children

This project aims to create an interactive, touch-based awareness model that helps children differentiate between safe and unsafe touch using visual indicators. The setup uses TTP223 capacitive touch sensors placed at different regions to represent safe and unsafe zones.

Implementation and Block Diagram are available in the uploaded project report.
